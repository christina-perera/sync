TODO:

- unit test json marshalling SyncWorkConfig and see why it won't produce all fields
- save job status at the begining then update its status during execution
- remove jsf backed beans (controller)
- use mysql baseline.sql and create index
- maybe consider use container provided jaxrs?
- url rewrite to make the forwarded jsp url look nicer
- cleanup
